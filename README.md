# Weather Report!
Weather Report hosted by David Lynch! Featuring cool icons I made. It was inspired by David Lynch's weather report youtube channel.

This is a discord bot that gives you nicely formatted images detailing the current and forecasted weather conditions of any requested city.

## Usage:
1. `/weather [city] [simplified: False]`
- Uploads an image showing current weather conditions and temperature in Celsius in the given city
- Also displays forecasted inter-day conditions and temperature on a tri-hourly period (from 9AM to midnight)
- The simplified parameter turns off the inter-day forecast and is `false` by default
- Example:

![/forecast los angeles](http://puu.sh/I7YbQ/3a60e7f268.jpg)
[full-sized image output](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/349267380452589568/882379404221743124/weather_report.png)

2. `/forecast [city] [transparent: False]`
- Uploads an image with inter-day forecasts (same tri-hourly period) as well as the average temperature and condition
- `transparent` uploads the image with a PNG alpha background instead of the solid white background, and is therefore also formatted a bit differently. Kinda like a dark mode I guess.
- Example:
![/forecast philadelphia true](http://puu.sh/I7Yen/63521ef909.jpg)

3. David Lynch also says good morning, followed by the day's date, and wishes everyone a great day every day at 7AM GMT :)
